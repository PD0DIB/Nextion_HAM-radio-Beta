# Model 10 - The new series

The Model 10 is based on Model 8, but evolved with new possibilities en features.

Not all Screentypes and -sizes are migrated to Model 10 yet, it is work-in-process

# REMARKS:
1) ** ALL MODEL 10 SCREENS ARE DESIGNED TO USE THE ON7LDS NextionDriver **

They will work without the NextionDriver, but some information like CPU Load, CPU Cycles, ... will not be displayed and Touch-buttons doesn't work without the NextionDriver (ON7LDS)
See https://github.com/on7lds/NextionDriverInstaller

2) Screens, designed specific for the Nextion Intelligent, can't be 'downgraded' to Basic or Enhanced type of Nextion screens. Since the Intelligent has some special attributes I'm using, they are not usable for other types of screens. 

ALL OTHER 7-inch (Basic and Enhanced) ARE IN THIS FOLDER TOO; just pick the correct filetype matching your screentype and GO....
